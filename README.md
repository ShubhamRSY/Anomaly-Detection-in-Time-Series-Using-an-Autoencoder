## Introduction

Anomaly detection in time series is a crucial task in data science and AI that helps in identifying patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior. This project implements an Autoencoder model for anomaly detection in time series data. Autoencoders are unsupervised learning models that can capture the underlying structure of data, making them a powerful tool for anomaly detection.

## Features

- Data preprocessing for time series data
- Implementation of an Autoencoder using TensorFlow/Keras
- Visualization of normal and anomalous time series
- Anomaly detection using reconstruction error
